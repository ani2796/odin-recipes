        <p>For vegans and anyone else who wants an interesting and healthy version of pulled pork. 
        It satisfied the craving of this 9-year vegetarian. You may eat this right away by making a sandwich with coleslaw or however you choose, but it is best to let it sit overnight in the refrigerator. 
        Then, reheat it. This is especially important if you do not have a slow cooker and choose to cook it in a skillet instead.

        <p>Vegan and healthy alternative for pulled pork. Best left to sit overnight in the refrigerator and reheated 
            (especially if skillet used instead of slow cooker), but can be eaten immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>3 cloves minced garlic</li>
            <li>3 pounds young green jackfruit packed in water and drained</li>
            <li>2 cups barbeque sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add jackfruit; cook and stir until lightly browned and relatively free of moisture, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer jackfruit mixture to a slow cooker; cover with barbeque sauce. Cook on Low, stirring occasionally, until jackfruit shreds easily with a fork, about 6 hours.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Cook's Notes</h2>
        <p>You may use jackfruit in brine but it is harder to flavor. Do not use the ripe kind which comes in syrup. If using frozen jackfruit, defrost before using. Rinse to remove all seeds and pods. Squeeze out as much water as possible with your hands.</p>
        <p>Dry rub or marinate the jackfruit in barbeque sauce or seasonings before cooking if you like. This will help if you use the brined version, do not let it sit overnight after cooking, or cook it in a skillet.</p>
        <p>If you don't have a slow cooker, cook jackfruit in a skillet (preferably cast iron) until easily shredded, about 2 hours.</p>
